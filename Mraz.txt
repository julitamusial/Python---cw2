When I look into your eyes.
It's like watching the night sky.
Or a beautiful sunrise.
But there's so much they hold.
I won't give, up on us.
Even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking-up.
And when you're needing yo.ur space.
To do some navigating.
I won't give up on us.
Even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still, looking up.
I'm still, looking up.
I won't give up on us.
God knows I'm tough enough
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
